# Generate Claude.md
```
I am a senior Software engineer working in finance industries. My work mainly around software design, development, and delivery. My current company use following tech stacks:
* C# .NET8 for backend micro services
* ReactJS with typescript for frontend applications
* Github, github actions, Kubenetes for infrastructure
* AWS lambda, dynomodb, sqs, kms and Kafka are the main thing we use in cloud
* Unit tests and Integration tests are must for development works. Frontend E2E tests are using Playwright
Now I want to adopt Claude Code to help me to perform works mention above. Please create a high level generic CLAUDE.md for me which I will put in my $HOME/.claude folder for all projects accross the board. Make sure you make it professional grade, and once you finish, take the result, think harder and refine it to get a final version.

Using a `spec.md` file in Kilo IDE (Kilo Code), an open-source AI coding assistant integrated with Visual Studio Code, involves leveraging its specification-driven development features to manage requirements, designs, and tasks for your project. The `spec.md` file is part of Kilo’s structured approach to defining and implementing features, bridging conceptual requirements and technical implementation. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to use a `spec.md` file in Kilo, based on available documentation and its integration with the Kiro agent, which Kilo uses for specification management.

### Overview of `spec.md` in Kilo
In Kilo, a `spec.md` file (or related files like `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`) is used to document and organize project specifications. Kilo, through its Kiro integration, generates and manages these files to capture:
- **Requirements**: User stories and acceptance criteria in structured formats like EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).
- **Design**: Technical architecture, data flows, and implementation considerations.
- **Tasks**: Discrete, trackable implementation steps.

The `spec.md` file typically resides in a `.kiro/specs/` directory within your project repository, often organized by feature (e.g., `.kiro/specs/user-authentication/spec.md`). It serves as a central hub for defining a feature’s requirements, design, and tasks, which Kilo’s AI agent (Kiro) can read, generate, or update.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using `spec.md` in Kilo

#### 1. **Set Up Your Project in Kilo**
- **Install Kilo Code**: If not already installed, download the Kilo Code extension from the VS Code Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kilocode.Kilo-Code) and install it in VS Code.[](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)
- **Open Your Project**: Use `File > Open Folder` in VS Code to load your project directory.
- **Initialize Kiro Specs**: If the `.kiro/specs/` directory doesn’t exist, create it manually or start a spec session to let Kiro set it up:
  - Open the Kilo chat interface (via the sidebar or `Ctrl+Shift+P` > “Kilo: Start Chat”).
  - Type a command like “Start a spec session for feature ‘user-authentication’” to create `.kiro/specs/user-authentication/`.

#### 2. **Create or Import a `spec.md` File**
Kilo supports both manual and automated ways to create or import a `spec.md` file.

- **Manual Creation**:
  - Create a file named `spec.md` in a feature-specific folder (e.g., `.kiro/specs/user-authentication/spec.md`).
  - Structure it using Markdown with sections for requirements, design, and tasks. For example:
    ```markdown
    # User Authentication Specification

    ## Requirements
    - WHEN a user enters valid credentials, THE SYSTEM SHALL grant access to the dashboard.
    - IF a user enters invalid credentials, THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message.

    ## Design
    - **Architecture**: REST API with JWT-based authentication.
    - **Data Flow**: Client → API Gateway → Auth Service → Database.

    ## Tasks
    - [ ] Implement login endpoint in `src/auth/login.ts`.
    - [ ] Set up JWT middleware.
    ```
  - Save the file in your project repository.

- **Import Existing Requirements**:
  - If you have requirements in another format (e.g., a `requirements.txt` or Word document), copy them into a Markdown file (e.g., `foo-prfaq.md`).
  - In the Kilo chat interface, initiate a spec session and reference the file:
    - Type: `#foo-prfaq.md Generate a spec from it`.
    - Kiro will read the file, parse the requirements, and generate a structured `spec.md` (or split into `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`) in the `.kiro/specs/` directory.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
  - Example command: “Generate a spec for a login feature from `user-requirements.md`.”

- **Automated Generation**:
  - Start a spec session in Kilo’s chat interface (e.g., via `Ctrl+Shift+P` > “Kilo: Start Spec Session”).
  - Describe your feature in natural language, e.g., “Create a spec for a user login system with password validation and session management.”
  - Kiro will generate a `spec.md` file (or separate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) in `.kiro/specs/<feature-name>/`, using EARS notation for requirements and structured Markdown for design and tasks.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/)

#### 3. **Structure of a `spec.md` File**
Kilo’s Kiro agent expects `spec.md` (or related files) to follow a structured format for clarity and automation. If you’re using a single `spec.md`, include these sections:

- **Requirements**: Use EARS notation for clarity (e.g., “WHEN <trigger>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>”). Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Requirements
  - WHEN a user submits a form with valid data, THE SYSTEM SHALL save the data to the database.
  - IF the form contains invalid data, THE SYSTEM SHALL display validation errors.
  ```
- **Design**: Document technical details like architecture, data models, or error handling. Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Design
  - **Architecture**: Client-side form validation with JavaScript, server-side validation with Node.js.
  - **Data Models**: User schema with fields `id`, `email`, `password`.
  - **Error Handling**: Return 400 status for invalid inputs.
  ```
- **Tasks**: List actionable steps with clear outcomes. Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Tasks
  - [ ] Create `User` schema in `src/models/user.ts`.
  - [ ] Implement form validation in `src/frontend/form.js`.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for validation logic.
  ```

Alternatively, Kiro may split these into separate files (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) for modularity, especially for complex features.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/)

#### 4. **Work with `spec.md` in Kilo**
Once created, use Kilo’s features to interact with the `spec.md` file:

- **Iterate on Specifications**:
  - Update requirements: Edit `spec.md` (or `requirements.md`) directly or use a spec session command like “Add a requirement to allow password reset.”
  - Refine design: In the chat interface, select the `design.md` file (or section) and type “Refine design to include OAuth support.” Kiro updates the file and related tasks.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
  - Update tasks: Run “Update tasks” in the chat interface or click the “Update tasks” option in `tasks.md` to sync tasks with modified requirements or design.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)

- **Execute Tasks**:
  - In a spec session, type “Execute all tasks in the spec” to have Kiro implement tasks from `tasks.md`. Note: Task-by-task execution is recommended for better accuracy.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
  - Example: For a task like “Implement login endpoint,” Kiro will generate code in the specified file (e.g., `src/auth/login.ts`) and update the task status.

- **Check Completed Tasks**:
  - If some tasks are already implemented (e.g., by a teammate), use Kilo to verify:
    - Open `tasks.md` and click “Update tasks” to mark completed tasks.
    - Or, in a spec session, type “Check which tasks are already complete.” Kiro scans the codebase and updates the task list.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)

- **Share Specs**:
  - Store `spec.md` in your project repository (e.g., under `.kiro/specs/`) to version-control it with Git, making it shareable with your team.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
  - For cross-team sharing, use Git submodules or a central specs repository to reference shared specs across projects.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)

#### 5. **Best Practices for `spec.md`**
- **Organize by Feature**: Create separate `spec.md` files for each feature (e.g., `.kiro/specs/user-authentication/spec.md`, `.kiro/specs/payment-processing/spec.md`) to avoid conflicts and keep specs focused.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
- **Use EARS Notation**: For requirements, follow EARS syntax (e.g., “WHEN <event>, THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>”) to ensure clarity and testability.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/)
- **Keep Specs Modular**: If Kiro splits specs into `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`, maintain this structure for clarity. Use a single `spec.md` only for simple features.
- **Leverage Kiro’s AI**: Use natural language commands in the chat interface to generate, refine, or execute specs. For example, “Generate a spec for a shopping cart” or “Refine tasks to include error handling.”
- **Version Control**: Commit `spec.md` files to your repository to track changes and collaborate with teammates.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
- **Test Incrementally**: After generating or updating `spec.md`, test Kiro’s code output (e.g., via “Execute all tasks”) in a sandbox environment to catch issues early.

#### 6. **Example Workflow**
Suppose you’re building a feature for a “user profile page.” Here’s how to use `spec.md`:
1. Start a spec session: In Kilo’s chat interface, type “Start a spec session for a user profile page.”
2. Kiro creates `.kiro/specs/user-profile/spec.md` (or separate `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`).
3. Review the generated spec:
   ```markdown
   # User Profile Specification

   ## Requirements
   - WHEN a user navigates to /profile, THE SYSTEM SHALL display their profile information.
   - IF the user updates their profile, THE SYSTEM SHALL save changes to the database.

   ## Design
   - **Architecture**: React frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB database.
   - **Data Models**: User schema with `name`, `email`, `bio`.

   ## Tasks
   - [ ] Create `Profile` component in `src/components/Profile.tsx`.
   - [ ] Implement `GET /profile` endpoint in `src/api/profile.ts`.
   - [ ] Add update logic in `src/api/profile.ts`.
   ```
4. Refine via chat: “Add a requirement for email validation.” Kiro updates `requirements.md` or `spec.md`.
5. Execute tasks: Type “Execute all tasks in the user-profile spec” or execute individually for precision.
6. Check completion: After coding, run “Check which tasks are already complete” to update the task list.

#### 7. **Potential Challenges and Solutions**
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Kiro misinterprets requirements | Use precise EARS notation in `spec.md` and clarify ambiguous prompts in the chat interface. |
| `spec.md` becomes too large | Split into `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` or create feature-specific specs.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
| Tasks not updating correctly | Run “Update tasks” or manually edit `tasks.md` to reflect changes.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
| Limited AI context | Use MCP integrations (e.g., for external tools like JIRA) to provide more context.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
| Collaboration issues | Store specs in a shared Git repository and use submodules for cross-team access.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)

#### 8. **Additional Notes**
- **Kiro vs. Kilo**: Kilo Code uses Kiro as its specification engine. References to Kiro in documentation (e.g.,,) apply to Kilo’s spec features.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/)
- **MCP Integration**: If your `spec.md` references external systems (e.g., JIRA for requirements), configure MCP servers in Kilo (Settings > MCP Support) to import data directly.[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)
- **Community Resources**: Check Kilo’s GitHub (https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode) or Kiro’s docs (https://kiro.dev) for updated spec templates and examples.,[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/best-practices/)[](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/concepts/)

If you have a specific feature or project in mind, provide details (e.g., “I’m building a login system”), and I can tailor a sample `spec.md` or refine this guide. Let me know!

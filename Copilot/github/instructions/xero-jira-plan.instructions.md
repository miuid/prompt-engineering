# Task Planning Instructions

## Resources Needed
- ALWAYS reference existing jira ticket
- ALWAYS use Atlassian tools (Jira, Confluence)
- ALWAYS reference linked work items in the jira ticket if they exist
- ALWAYS reference linked confluence pages in the jira ticket if they exist
- ALWAYS reference current open codebase
- ALWAYS follow existing coding standards and patterns in the codebase
- ALWAYS read relevant documentation
- ALWAYS look for github url in the jira ticket and use it to access the repository or pull request
- ALWAYS use github tools if you have access to a repository url
- ALWAYS use relevant libraries and frameworks as per the project guidelines

## Task Creation
- ALWAYS Update the current jira ticket with the plan and any additional information if it's description is not sufficient.
- ALWAYS Ask for permission before creating new jira tickets
- ALWAYS Ask whether to create sub-tasks under a parent ticket or single ticket
- DON'T create tasks that are too small or too detailed. Split multiple tasks into tasks if they are closely related.

- New tickets must have the same fields as current ticket, including:
  - Labels
  - Components
  - Taxonomy of Demand
  - Parent
  - Team

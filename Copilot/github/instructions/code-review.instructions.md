## Review Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Information Gathering & Context Analysis

When given a GitHub pull request URL (ask for it if not provided), follow this systematic approach:

#### 1.1 Fetch PR Details
```markdown
First, I need to understand the pull request context:
- What is the purpose of this PR?
- What files are being changed?
- How many commits are involved?
- Are there existing comments or reviews?
```

**Actions to take:**
- Use `#get_pull_request` to fetch PR metadata, description, and context
- Use `#get_pull_request_files` to understand the scope of changes
- Use `#get_pull_request_diff` to analyze the actual code changes
- Use `#get_pull_request_comments` and `#get_pull_request_reviews` to see existing feedback

#### 1.2 Analyze Change Scope
```markdown
Understanding the impact:
- Is this a feature addition, bug fix, refactor, or breaking change?
- Which modules/components are affected?
- Are there any architectural implications?
```

**Actions to take:**
- Use `#codebase` to search for related code patterns
- Use `#usages` to find where modified functions/classes are used
- Use `#search` to locate similar implementations
- Use `#findTestFiles` to identify relevant test files

#### 1.3 Clarification Questions
If the PR context is unclear, ask targeted questions:

```markdown
Before I proceed with the detailed review, I need to clarify:

1. **Purpose Clarity**: [If PR description is vague]
	- What specific problem does this PR solve?
	- What is the expected behavior after this change?

2. **Scope Verification**: [If changes seem extensive]
	- Are all these changes related to the stated objective?
	- Should this be broken into smaller PRs?

3. **Breaking Changes**: [If API changes detected]
	- Are these breaking changes intentional?
	- Has backward compatibility been considered?

4. **Testing Strategy**: [If tests are missing/inadequate]
	- How should this functionality be tested?
	- Are there specific edge cases to consider?

5. **Dependencies**: [If external changes detected]
	- Do these changes depend on other PRs or deployments?
	- Are there any configuration changes required?
```

### Phase 2: Deep Code Analysis

#### 2.1 Programming Principles Assessment

**SOLID Principles Review:**
```markdown
## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Does each class/function have one clear responsibility?
- Are there functions doing multiple unrelated things?

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Is the code open for extension but closed for modification?
- Would adding new features require modifying existing code?

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Can derived classes substitute base classes without breaking functionality?
- Are inheritance relationships logical and maintainable?

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Are interfaces focused and not forcing unnecessary dependencies?
- Could large interfaces be broken into smaller, specific ones?

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Does the code depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations?
- Are dependencies properly injected rather than hard-coded?
```

**Code Quality Fundamentals:**
```markdown
## Readability & Maintainability
- Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?
- Is the code self-documenting or does it need more comments?
- Are functions appropriately sized (typically 10-20 lines)?
- Is there excessive complexity that should be simplified?

## Error Handling
- Are all potential error scenarios handled appropriately?
- Are error messages helpful and informative?
- Is there proper input validation?
- Are resources properly cleaned up in error scenarios?

## Performance Considerations
- Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks?
- Could algorithms be more efficient?
- Are there unnecessary database queries or API calls?
- Is caching used appropriately?

## Security Assessment
- Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are sensitive operations properly authorized?
- Is data properly encrypted where necessary?
```

#### 2.2 Pattern Consistency Analysis

**Search for Existing Patterns:**
```markdown
I'll analyze existing codebase patterns to ensure consistency:

1. **Similar Functionality Search**
	- Search for similar functions/classes in the codebase
	- Compare implementation approaches
	- Identify pattern deviations

2. **Naming Convention Verification**
	- Check if naming follows established patterns
	- Verify consistency with similar components
	- Ensure conventions align with team standards

3. **Error Handling Patterns**
	- Compare error handling with existing code
	- Ensure consistent error reporting mechanisms
	- Verify exception handling follows established patterns

4. **Testing Patterns**
	- Compare test structure with existing tests
	- Ensure consistent testing approaches
	- Verify coverage follows team standards
```

**Actions to take:**
- Use `#search` with function names, class names, and patterns
- Use `#codebase` to find similar implementations
- Use `#usages` to understand how patterns are typically used
- Compare with established conventions in the project

#### 2.3 Breaking Change Analysis

**Impact Assessment Process:**
```markdown
## API Compatibility Check
- Are any public interfaces being modified?
- Are function signatures changing?
- Are return types being altered?
- Are any public methods being removed?

## Database Schema Changes
- Are there database migrations involved?
- Could schema changes break existing queries?
- Are there proper rollback procedures?

## Configuration Changes
- Are new configuration options required?
- Could missing configuration cause runtime failures?
- Are default values appropriate?

## Dependency Impact
- Are there version changes in dependencies?
- Could dependency updates introduce breaking changes?
- Are there new transitive dependencies with conflicts?
```

**Systematic Breaking Change Detection:**
```markdown
1. **Function/Method Analysis**
	- Use `#usages` to find all call sites for modified functions
	- Check if parameter changes affect existing calls
	- Verify return type changes don't break consumers

2. **Class/Interface Analysis**
	- Search for all implementations and extensions
	- Check if property changes affect existing usage
	- Verify inheritance chains remain intact

3. **Module/Package Analysis**
	- Check if export changes affect importing modules
	- Verify public API surface remains compatible
	- Look for removed or renamed exports

4. **Integration Points**
	- Check API endpoint changes for external consumers
	- Verify database changes don't break existing queries
	- Check configuration changes for deployment impact
```

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Review Execution

#### 3.1 Systematic Code Review

**File-by-File Analysis:**
```markdown
For each modified file, I will analyze:

## Code Structure & Organization
- Is the file logically organized?
- Are imports clean and necessary?
- Is there proper separation of concerns?

## Implementation Quality
- Is the logic correct and efficient?
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?

## Testing Adequacy
- Are there corresponding tests for new functionality?
- Do tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?
- Is test coverage adequate?

## Documentation & Comments
- Is complex logic properly documented?
- Are public APIs documented?
- Are comments helpful and up-to-date?
- Is inline documentation sufficient?
```

#### 3.2 Cross-File Impact Analysis

**Integration Analysis:**
```markdown
## Module Interactions
- How do changes affect other modules?
- Are all integration points properly tested?
- Could changes cause unexpected side effects?

## Data Flow Analysis
- How does data flow through the modified components?
- Are there any potential data integrity issues?
- Could changes affect data consistency?

## Performance Impact
- Could changes affect application performance?
- Are there new bottlenecks introduced?
- Should performance testing be conducted?
```

#### 3.3 Security & Compliance Review

**Security Checklist:**
```markdown
## Input Validation
- Are all inputs properly validated?
- Is there protection against injection attacks?
- Are file uploads handled securely?

## Authentication & Authorization
- Are security controls properly implemented?
- Is access properly restricted?
- Are permissions checked at appropriate levels?

## Data Protection
- Is sensitive data properly protected?
- Are there any data exposure risks?
- Is logging avoiding sensitive information?

## Communication Security
- Are API calls made over secure channels?
- Are credentials properly managed?
- Is data properly encrypted in transit?

- **Acceptable:** Requires some improvements, noticeable areas for enhancement
- **Needs Improvement:** Significant issues, major improvements required
- **Unacceptable:** Critical flaws, fundamental issues, requires rework

## Coding Standards

### Code Structure and Organization
- **Single Responsibility:** Methods and classes should have one clear purpose
- **Readable Names:** Use descriptive, intention-revealing names following C# conventions
- **Early Returns:** Reduce nesting with guard clauses and early returns
- **Consistent Style:** Follow project conventions and formatting standards
- **Avoid God Classes/Methods:** Split large classes and methods into smaller, focused units
- **Clear Architecture:** Separate business logic, data access, and UI layers

### Naming Conventions
- **C# Standards:** PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private/local variables
- **Constants:** Use `const` or `static readonly` with descriptive names (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Avoid Magic Values:** Replace hardcoded numbers/strings with named constants
- **Meaningful Names:** Avoid abbreviations and single-character variables (except loop counters)
- **Method Names:** Should clearly describe their functionality and behavior

### Control Flow and Logic
- **Reduce Nesting:** Use early returns and guard clauses to minimize if-statement nesting
- **Switch Statements:** Prefer switch over multiple if-else chains, include default cases
- **Complex Conditions:** Extract complex boolean logic into named methods or variables
- **Loop Optimization:** Choose appropriate loop types, avoid repeated calculations inside loops
- **Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, avoid empty catch blocks

### Error Handling and Resource Management
- **Specific Exceptions:** Catch specific exception types rather than generic `Exception`
- **Try-Catch Placement:** Wrap risky operations (file I/O, JSON parsing, network calls)
- **Resource Disposal:** Use `using` statements for IDisposable resources
- **Finally Blocks:** Use only for cleanup, never throw exceptions from finally
- **Logging:** Log exceptions with appropriate detail, avoid sensitive data in logs
- **Re-throwing:** Use `throw;` to preserve original stack trace when re-throwing

### Performance Optimization
- **Object Allocation:** Minimize object creation in loops and hot paths
- **Data Structures:** Choose appropriate collections (List, Dictionary, HashSet) for use case
- **String Operations:** Use StringBuilder for concatenation, avoid repeated string operations
- **Caching:** Cache expensive operations and frequently accessed data
- **Database Calls:** Minimize query frequency, use efficient queries
- **Loop Efficiency:** Store collection counts in variables, avoid property calls in loops

### Asynchronous Programming
- **Async/Await:** Use for I/O-intensive operations to improve responsiveness
- **Avoid Blocking:** Never use `Task.Wait()` or `Task.Result` in async contexts
- **ConfigureAwait:** Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code to avoid deadlocks
- **ValueTask:** Consider for high-frequency async operations
- **Cancellation:** Support cancellation tokens for long-running operations

### Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation
- **XSS Prevention:** Encode output, validate input data
- **Sensitive Data:** Never hardcode passwords, API keys, or secrets
- **Secure Storage:** Use configuration files or key management for sensitive data
- **Authentication:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Dependency Injection and SOLID Principles
- **Constructor Injection:** Prefer constructor injection to clarify dependencies
- **Interface Segregation:** Create focused, specific interfaces rather than large ones
- **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Design for extension without modification
- **Liskov Substitution:** Ensure derived classes can replace base classes seamlessly
- **Lifecycle Management:** Configure appropriate service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient)

### Modern C# Features
- **Nullable Reference Types:** Enable and properly handle null checks
- **Pattern Matching:** Use modern pattern matching features for cleaner code
- **Records:** Use record types for immutable data structures
- **Null Operators:** Utilize `??`, `?.`, and `??=` for null handling
- **LINQ:** Leverage LINQ for data operations, avoid multiple enumerations
- **Local Functions:** Use for helper methods within method scope

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Test Coverage:** Aim for high coverage with meaningful tests
- **Boundary Testing:** Test edge cases, null inputs, and error conditions
- **Test Isolation:** Use mocking to avoid external dependencies
- **Test Naming:** Follow naming conventions (MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior)
- **Repeatability:** Ensure tests are deterministic and independent
- **Integration Tests:** Add integration tests for API endpoints and workflows

### Documentation and Maintainability
- **XML Documentation:** Document public APIs with XML comments
- **Complex Logic:** Comment business rules and algorithmic complexity
- **README Updates:** Update documentation for significant changes
- **Code Comments:** Explain why, not what the code does
- **Consistent Formatting:** Use consistent indentation, spacing, and style

### Logging and Monitoring
- **Appropriate Levels:** Use correct log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
- **Structured Logging:** Include relevant context and correlation IDs
- **Sensitive Data:** Never log passwords, tokens, or personal information
- **Performance Metrics:** Log execution times for critical operations
- **Error Context:** Include sufficient context for debugging

### Language-Specific (.NET/C#)
- **Types:** Prefer explicit types over `var` for clarity when type isn't obvious
- **JSON Operations:** Handle exceptions, minimize deserializations, use settings
- **Collections:** Use appropriate collection types and avoid unnecessary allocations
- **Memory Management:** Be aware of large object heap and garbage collection impact
- **Threading:** Use thread-safe collections and proper synchronization when needed

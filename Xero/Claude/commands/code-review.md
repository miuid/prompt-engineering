# Claude Command: Comprehensive Code Review

You are a **Principal Engineer** conducting a thorough code review of changes in the current working branch against the main branch (or master if main doesn't exist). Your review should be comprehensive, educational, and focused on maintaining high code quality standards.

## üéØ Review Objectives

Conduct a multi-layered analysis covering:
- **Code Quality & Best Practices**: SOLID principles, clean code, maintainability
- **Architecture & Design**: System design, patterns, scalability considerations
- **Security & Compliance**: Vulnerability assessment, data protection, secure coding
- **Performance & Optimization**: Efficiency, resource usage, bottlenecks
- **Testing & Reliability**: Coverage, edge cases, error handling
- **Team Standards**: Consistency with existing codebase patterns

## üîç Review Process

### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Change Discovery

1. **Identify Changes**
   ```bash
   # Get overview of all changes
   git status -s
   git diff --name-only main..HEAD
   git log --oneline main..HEAD
   ```

2. **Analyze Change Scope**
   - Examine the diff to understand what was modified, added, or removed
   - Look for patterns in the changes (feature addition, refactoring, bug fix, etc.)
   - Identify the core components and modules affected
   - Check for any breaking changes or API modifications

3. **Gather Context**
   - Read commit messages to understand the intent behind changes
   - Look for related files and dependencies that might be affected
   - Search for similar implementations in the codebase for consistency
   - Identify any configuration, documentation, or test files that should be updated

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Code Analysis

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Review

**System Design Assessment:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Does each component have a clear, focused purpose?
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Is the code extensible without modification?
- **Dependency Management**: Are dependencies properly abstracted and injected?
- **Interface Design**: Are interfaces clean, focused, and well-defined?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Is business logic separated from infrastructure concerns?

**Design Patterns & Anti-Patterns:**
- Identify and evaluate design patterns used (Strategy, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Look for anti-patterns: God objects, circular dependencies, tight coupling
- Check for proper abstraction levels and appropriate use of inheritance vs composition
- Evaluate error handling strategies and exception propagation

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Assess how changes will perform under load
- Look for potential bottlenecks or resource constraints
- Evaluate caching strategies and data access patterns
- Consider horizontal and vertical scaling implications

#### üîí Security Review

**Input Validation & Sanitization:**
- Check all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- Look for SQL injection, XSS, and other injection vulnerabilities
- Verify file upload security and path traversal protection
- Ensure proper encoding/decoding of data

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Review access control implementations
- Check for proper session management
- Verify role-based permissions are correctly enforced
- Look for privilege escalation vulnerabilities

**Data Protection:**
- Ensure sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit
- Check for data leakage in logs, error messages, or debug output
- Verify compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Review key management and credential storage practices

**Secure Communication:**
- Verify HTTPS/TLS usage for all external communications
- Check certificate validation and pinning where appropriate
- Review API security headers and CORS configurations
- Assess third-party integration security

#### ‚ö° Performance & Optimization Review

**Algorithm Efficiency:**
- Analyze time and space complexity of new algorithms
- Look for opportunities to optimize loops, recursion, and data structures
- Check for unnecessary computations or redundant operations
- Evaluate database query efficiency and N+1 problems

**Resource Management:**
- Review memory usage patterns and potential leaks
- Check for proper resource cleanup (files, connections, etc.)
- Assess thread safety and concurrency handling
- Look for blocking operations that could be asynchronous

**Caching & Data Access:**
- Evaluate caching strategies and cache invalidation logic
- Review database access patterns and query optimization
- Check for appropriate use of lazy loading vs eager loading
- Assess API rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

#### üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
- Verify unit tests exist for new functionality
- Check integration tests cover component interactions
- Ensure edge cases and error scenarios are tested
- Review test quality and maintainability

**Error Handling & Resilience:**
- Check comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Verify graceful degradation under failure conditions
- Review retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- Assess logging and monitoring capabilities

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- Evaluate code complexity and maintainability
- Check for code duplication and opportunities for refactoring
- Review naming conventions and code readability
- Assess documentation quality and completeness

### Phase 3: Consistency & Standards Review

#### üìã Team Standards Compliance

**Coding Standards:**
- Verify adherence to established coding conventions
- Check formatting, naming, and style consistency
- Review comment quality and documentation standards
- Ensure proper use of language-specific idioms

**Pattern Consistency:**
- Compare implementations with existing similar code
- Check for consistent error handling approaches
- Verify logging patterns match team standards
- Ensure configuration management follows established patterns

**Integration Standards:**
- Review API design consistency with existing endpoints
- Check database schema changes follow migration standards
- Verify deployment and configuration requirements are documented
- Ensure monitoring and alerting are properly configured

### Phase 4: Neighbor File Analysis

**Related Code Examination:**
- Identify files that are similar in purpose or structure to changed files
- Compare implementation approaches for consistency
- Look for opportunities to extract common functionality
- Check if changes affect related components or dependencies

**Impact Assessment:**
- Use semantic search to find code that might be affected by changes
- Check for breaking changes in public APIs or interfaces
- Verify backward compatibility where required
- Assess migration requirements for dependent systems
